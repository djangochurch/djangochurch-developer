Deployment
==========

Django Church can be deployed on host which meets the :ref:`minimum
requirements <requirements>` for the project.

If you're unfamiliar with Django deployment, we recommend that you should read
the `deploying Django <django:deploying-django>`_ documentation. The Django
Church deployment documentation is intended to show the basics of deployment
with the Django Church packages.
